# The Savior App

Why create a killer app when you can create a SAVIOR app? The Savior App educates and inspires developers while saving the world. Building upon the computer science principles put forth by revolutionary projects such as the Wu-Tang Name Generator and the Change-o-Chart 2000 from Nobel laureate Professor Poopypants, the Savior App generates impactful Internet Computer app ideas grounded in the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
