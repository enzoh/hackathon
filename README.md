# The Savior App

Why create a killer app when you can create a SAVIOR app? The Savior App educates and inspires developers while saving the world. Building upon the computer science principles put forth by revolutionary projects such as the Wu-Tang Name Generator and the Change-o-Chart 2000 from Nobel laureate Professor Poopypants, the Savior App generates impactful Internet Computer app ideas grounded in the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

IMPORTANT!

In order to successfully build canisters:

- You will need to install `V0.5.8` of dfx
- You will also need to replace `stanleyjones` with your username in `package.json`.
- You will need to replace `0.5.7` for `0.5.8` in `dfx.json` `package-lock.json` and `package.json`.
