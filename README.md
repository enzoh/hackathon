# The Hero App Generator

Why create a killer app when you can create a hero app? The Hero App Generator educates and inspires developers while saving the world. Building upon the computer science principles put forth by revolutionary projects such as the Wu-Tang Name Generator and the Change-o-Chart 2000 from Nobel laureate Professor Poopypants, the Hero App Generator suggests impactful Internet Computer app ideas grounded in the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

To get started, you should have the latest version of `dfx` installed. You might want to explore the project directory structure and the default configuration file. Working with this project in your development environment will not affect any production deployment or identity tokens.

In order to successfully build canisters:

- You will need to install `0.5.8` of dfx
- You will need to replace `0.5.7` with `0.5.8` in `dfx.json` `package-lock.json` and `package.json`.

To learn more before you start working with the Hero App Generator, see the following documentation available online:

- [Developer's Guide](https://sdk.dfinity.org/developers-guide)
- [Language Reference](https://sdk.dfinity.org/language-guide)

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd hero-app-generator/
dfx start --background
npm install
dfx build --skip-frontend
dfx build
dfx canister install --all
